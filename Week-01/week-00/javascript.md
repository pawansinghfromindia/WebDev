How it works?

|          | Computer |          |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Mouse    | RAM      | CPU      |
| Keyboard | SSD/HDD  | Processor|
| Monitor  |          | GPU      |

| Applications (App) |
|--------------------|
| VLC                |
| WhatsApp           |
| Zoom               |
| Chrome             |

These applications, we installed locally on our machine(computer).

Any app installed on our machine resides in (SSD/HDD).

| SSD | Solid State Drive | Flash Memory | New Technology | Uses : Silicon's Physical and Chemical properties | eff++, speed++, volume++|
|-----|-------------------|--------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| HDD | Hard Disk Drive   | Magnetic Disk| Old Technology | Uses : Aluminium, Copper, Steel, Silver, Gold,Platinum| eff--,speed--|

Our computer specs Like 1TB Hard Disk or 500GB of SSD and Photos/Videos on our machine(computer) is stored on HDD/SDD.

When we start our application (running apps), It runs in **RAM**. <br/>
Whatever current application running that will reside in RAM, rest applications reside in SDD/HDD.

In static state, normally App resides in **SSD/HDD**(Hard Disk) | Hardware.<br/>
As we open it or double click -> Running State. <br/>
This is the time, it will go to RAM. (RAM is a hardware) <br/>

**Que : What is RAM or HDD/SDD?** 
- It is hardware (Wire, Circuits)
> At the lowest level, our machine only understands 0s 1s (Binary) 2 things 0 means off and 1 means on.

Any final program, we run on our machine. Be it a game PubG, Chrome browser, videoplayer that looks very fancy.

- In the end what's running in the RAM 01011100101 bunch of numbers (combination of 0 and 1).

**Why is so?**
- Bcuz RAM only understand 0s 1s.
- RAM is hardware which knows 0 and 1 like on and off.
- These can be only 2 state -> On and Off.
- Those states can be represented by 0 and 1.

**Que : What exactly goes into RAM?**
- So, whenever we execute anything our machine(computer). It goes into RAM.
- What goes into RAM is 0s 1s only, Not any source code, c++ or java or python program.

**Que : Does that mean Application Developers write code in 0s 1s (100101010) in Binary while writing the code of application?**
- Answer is **NO**. They write code in C/C++/Java/Python/JavaScript etc.
- e.g. : VLC -> in C-Language (Open source software, you can see the code of it)

**Que : then How does the code written in C/C++/Java/Python/JS converted to 0s 1s 10101010101 Binary?**
- Answer is something called **Compiler**

C/C++/Java/Python/JS all of them are **high level language** in which developer write code like ```hello.c```, ```hello.cpp```, 
```hello.java```, ```hello.py```, ```hello.js``` etc.

All of languages have **Compiler** which converts the high-level code into 0s 1s(Binary) which goes into RAM and our machine understand
and execute(run) it.

That's why we need programming languages. <br/>
Bcuz Developers are very dumb and they can't write code in binary or 0s 1s or Low-level code. <br/>
It is very hard to code in 0s 1s (Binary). <br/>
It is easy to write in high-level language.
- for loop, while loop
- if else
- logical statements

Thankfully, We have Compiler that underhood convert high-level code(logic, if else, loop) into 0s 1s(Binary).

As of now, we know Why languages?
- C/C++/Java/Python/JavaScript

**Que : Why not one language for programming instead we have so many languages?**
- Bcuz Developers have various optimization and some usecases can only be build in certain languages only.

- e.g. : Browser code can only in HTML/CSS/JS
- Most of program can be in any languages.
- These are some advantages to some languages which is why everyone created their own and they have competition among each other.

In the end every programming language is just converting High Level Code into 0s 1s (Binary).

Why language? Now we have learned.
1. Languages are used to write applications.
2. Developers write High-level code in these languages.
3. Every language has a **Compiler** which converts the developer code(High-Level Code) into 0s 1s (Binary Code/Low-Level Code)

**Apps** ---> **Compiler** --> **RAM(SSD/HDD)**

> Compiler is also a software which is very closed to Hardware written in Low-level language.

This is the basics of why we need High-Level Programming languages. because developers can't write code in 0s 1s (Binary).
